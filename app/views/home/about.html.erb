<h2>About Retrospective</h2>
<p>Retrospective: Putting UA Stories on the Map is a student-created project through the University of Alabama’s Creative Campus. By connecting personal stories to specific locations, both past and present, we hope to preserve the memories that our campus holds as the University continues to grow and change through the years. Our idea is that we can connect the University’s campus to the people who make it come alive through a retelling of the stories that make each place special.</p>

<p>Retrospective is meant to serve as an open forum for students, faculty, staff, alumni, community members and all others connected to the University to share their stories no matter the topic matter. In good faith that our contributors remain respectful, we do not edit, censor or curate any of our submissions. However, if we feel a story is disingenuous or intentionally harmful to others, we reserve the right to leave it off the website.</p>
